# 🚀 BDD Kata 📝

This repository is a practice environment for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles. It includes exercises to help you understand and implement BDD scenarios and features.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running the exercises, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

## 🏆 Exercises

### 📖 1. Write Scenarios for Book Checkout Feature

Your first exercise is to write BDD scenarios for a **book-checkout** feature. This involves defining clear Given-When-Then scenarios using Gherkin syntax.

Expand on this feature by considering edge cases like overdue books, reaching checkout limits, or returning books.


### 🏦 2. Implement the Bank Account Management Feature

The second exercise is to implement the **bank-account-management** feature using BDD.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Once you've defined the scenarios and implemented the features, run the tests using:

```sh
npm test
```

After running the tests you can view the report using:

```sh
npm run report
```
