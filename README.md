# BDD Kata

This repository is a practice environment for Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles. It includes exercises to help you understand and implement BDD scenarios and features.

## Prerequisites

Before running the exercises, ensure you have Node.js installed. Then, install the necessary dependencies by running:

```sh
npm install
```

## Exercises

### 1. Write Scenarios for Book Checkout Feature

Your first exercise is to write BDD scenarios for a **book-checkout** feature. This involves defining clear Given-When-Then scenarios using Gherkin syntax.

Expand on this feature by considering edge cases like overdue books, reaching checkout limits, or returning books.

### 2. Implement the Bank Account Management Feature

The second exercise is to implement the **bank-account-management** feature using BDD. This feature has the different scenarios already defined and you should implement the testing steps to test it


## Running Tests

Once you've defined the scenarios and implemented the features, run the tests using:

```sh
npm test
```

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute by adding more BDD scenarios and implementations. Create a pull request with your changes.
